# Autonomous Vehicle Path Planning Using Parallel Processing

## Overview
This project focuses on **real-time path planning** for autonomous vehicles using deep learning models, with an emphasis on **parallel processing** to improve training efficiency and performance. The project implements **CNN** and **ResNet-18** models to predict steering angles based on raw input images from the CARLA dataset. By leveraging PyTorch's parallelization capabilities, we achieve significant reductions in computation time and enhance model accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Parallel vs. Serial Training**: Implemented parallel processing to utilize multiple CPU cores and GPUs, reducing training time by 90% compared to serial execution.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Inspired by NVIDIA's end-to-end self-driving car research.
  - **ResNet-18**: Fine-tuned for regression tasks to predict steering angles.
- **Dataset**: The CARLA simulator dataset consisting of **186k road images** with corresponding steering angle data across varying weather conditions.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
  - Epoch Duration

## Results
### CNN Model
| Implementation | Training Loss | Validation Loss | R² Score | Epoch Duration (s) |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Serial         | 0.0041       | 0.0044          | 0.4898   | ~3000             |
| Parallel       | 0.0029       | 0.0027          | 0.6570   | ~336              |

### ResNet-18 Model
| Implementation | Validation Loss | Validation RMSE |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Serial         | 0.0007          | 0.0265          |
| Parallel       | 0.0003          | 0.0214          |

**Key Insight**: Parallelization led to **90% faster training** and more accurate steering predictions.
